# What is this repository for?

This repository is aimed at cloning the source code of pthsem. It currently contains the version 2.0.8 of pthsem, as originally posted on its author's webpage [here](https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/index.php/pth).
Pthsem is a modified version of GNU Pth that adds semaphore functionality to the original library. Martin's initial intent seemed to propose his change as an enhancement of the GNU Pth library. For some reason, his proposal has never been accepted and integrated by the GNU gurus, depite its obvious usefulness. The main consequence is that this code is no longer maintained and is only available on Martin's webpage for reference purposes.
Considering the project has been abandoned for a long time and the requirement it represents to build Linknx, we copied it here as a backup in case Martin Kögler decides to shut his own webpage down.

By no means does this clone intend to represent the official version of pthsem. All credits go to Martin Kögler for this helpful piece of software. 

We are planning on getting rid of this dependency at some point, like knxd did in the past. Monitor [this issue](https://github.com/linknx/linknx/issues/28) for details.

# Should I get pthsem here?

As long as the original webpage is alive, we recommend to get your copy of pthsem there.

# Documentation

Read the original [README file](/README) that is part of Martin's work for details about what pthsem is. You will find valuable information on Martin's webpage as well.
